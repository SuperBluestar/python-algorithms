# Question: Algorithms
### Given a list of integers and a target integer, write a function that expresses the target integer by inserting + and - operations between the list items. 
For example:
```result
>>> f([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 9)
'9 = 1 + 2 - 3 + 4 + 5'
>>> f([2, 5, 60, -5, 3], 69)
'69 = 2 + 5 + 60 - -5 - 3'
>>> f([2, 5, 10], 50)
None
```
All list items must be used in the solution, they cannot be skipped.
If there are multiple ways to express the target integer, return any.
If there is no way to express the target integer, return None.
Your algorithm should be as efficient as possible.
Analyse the running time of your algorithm and discuss whether it is optimal.
